# HashId

HashId lets you hide your database ids with on the spot generated hashes. The hases will be valid 100% of the time unless you change the salt this can also be used to create confirmation codes or tracking numbers.

## Installing BitSwitch

You can install HashId with [RubyGems](https://rubygems.org/gems/hashid).

`gem install hashid` or `gem 'hashid'`

## Contributing to BitSwitch
 
* Check out the latest master to make sure the feature hasn't been implemented or the bug hasn't been fixed yet.
* Check out the issue tracker to make sure someone already hasn't requested it and/or contributed it.
* Fork the project.
* Start a feature/bugfix branch.
* Commit and push until you are happy with your contribution.
* Make sure to add tests for it. This is important so I don't break it in a future version unintentionally.
* Please try not to mess with the Rakefile, version, or history. If you want to have your own version, or is otherwise necessary, that is fine, but please isolate to its own commit so I can cherry-pick around it.

## Todo

* Write some documentation
